# Building the client
Before proceeding, install a [JDK](https://jdk.java.net/archive/) (must be Java 11 or later) and [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

Ensure `JAVA_HOME` is set correctly and the `mvn` executable is available on your PATH.

Run the following command in a terminal/console.
```bash
mvn clean install
```

This compiles the client into your local maven repository.
