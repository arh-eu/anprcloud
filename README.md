# Building the client
Before proceeding, install a [JDK](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html) (must be Java 8 or later) and [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

Ensure `JAVA_HOME` is set correctly and the `mvn` executable is available on your PATH.

Run the following command in a terminal/console.
```bash
mvn clean install
```

This compiles the client into your local maven repository.
