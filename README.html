<h1>Building the sample</h1>
<p>Before proceeding, install a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html">JDK</a> (must be Java 8 or later) and <a href="https://maven.apache.org/install.html">Apache Maven</a>.</p>
<p>Ensure <code>JAVA_HOME</code> is set correctly and the <code>mvn</code> executable is available on your PATH.</p>
<p>There are two approaches to building the sample.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can compile just the sample and publish to a repository that handles dependency management like MavenCentral.  (Recommended)</li>
<li>You can build a &quot;fat jar&quot; that contains all required dependencies; this jar can be added to your customers' classpath.</li>
</ol>
<h2>1. Building a single jar</h2>
<p>Run the following command in a terminal/console.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mvn package
</code></pre>
<p>This compiles the sample into a jar located at <code>./target/anprcloud-sample-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar</code>. Note that this jar does not include any dependencies.</p>
<h2>2. Building a Standalone Jar</h2>
<p>If your customers aren't using Maven or Gradle and you would prefer to distribute a single JAR with all dependencies, you can use the following command to build a fat jar.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mvn clean package -Pstandalone-jar
</code></pre>
<p>This will compile the sample and package all dependencies into a jar located at <code>./target/anprcloud-sample-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar</code>.</p>
